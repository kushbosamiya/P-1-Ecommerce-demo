It is one of the most common indigestion problems that people face. There could be a number of reasons that could lead to bloating like not chewing food properly, eating too quickly and overeating. However, you can combat bloating with the use of foods available in your house instead of taking over-the-counter medicines which may come with a host of side-effects, if taken for a long time.</p>

<h2 id=""heading-foods-to-reduce-bloating-quickly"">Foods to reduce bloating quickly</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Buttermilk (Chaas)</strong>: Buttermilk is a natural probiotic and one of the best anti-bloating foods. The good bacteria present in probiotics prevent the gas build-up and bloating that often causes acid reflux. It also allows nutrients and foods to be digested and absorbed correctly, which ultimately eliminates and reduces the possibility of occurrence of acidity.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong> Banana</strong>: Eating ripe bananas may help reduce gas and bloating as they are packed with potassium and soluble fibre. They help the body flush out excess sodium and reduce inflammation as too much salt can result in bloating and gas. Soluble fibre also helps to relieve constipation, which can be another cause of bloating.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Asafoetida (Hing)</strong>: Hing when added to delicacies adds a certain flavour and the medicinal properties present in it make it one of the best anti-bloating foods. Adding a dash of hing while cooking certain foods like chickpeas and potato prevents bloating and gastric issues. Another useful way to reduce bloating quickly is by drinking a mix of hing powder and black salt in a glassful of lukewarm water. You can also take a pinch of hing and mix it with a few drops of warm mustard oil and massage it on the navel to get relief from bloating and gas.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Fennel seeds (Saunf)</strong>: Fennel seeds are a digestive tract saviour and possess antispasmodic properties. The seeds have a compound that relaxes gastrointestinal spasms, which allows gas to pass and relieve bloating. You can chew few fennel seeds after every meal or sip on a fennel tea after meals to ease the digestion process.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ginger</strong>: Ginger contains the digestive enzyme zingibain, which helps your digestive system break down protein. The compound potentially helps food to get digested easily, reducing bloating, gas or constipation. If you already feel bloated, you probably don't want to eat. So, you can simply eat ginger slices soaked in lemon juice or you can make ginger tea by adding a few slices of ginger to water and boil it for 5-10 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Cucumber </strong>: is high in potassium, which helps negate the ill-effects of sodium that is known to cause bloating. It helps you eliminate extra sodium through urine. Cucumbers are rich in antioxidant quercetin, caffeic acid (the skin), vitamin C and silica that are known to reduce swelling. Just as how putting them around your eyes prevent puffiness, eating cucumber on a daily basis can help you de-bloat as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If food from home didn't work in reducing bloating, one should opt for ayurvedic medicine for bloating and gas by consulting with a doctor. In addition to incorporating anti-bloating foods into your diet, several other things when kept in mind can help prevent bloating. For example, be sure to eat slowly and chew your food thoroughly. This can help reduce how much air you swallow to prevent gas buildup. Refrain from eating too much salt. An excess of sodium causes the body to retain water. This can cause a swollen and bloated feeling in the stomach.</p>

<p>Ayurveda is a treasure trove of herbs and <strong><em>rasayanas</em></strong> that helps treat and heal the illnesses. Eczema skin condition is known as ‘<strong><em>vicharchika</em></strong>’ in Ayurveda and there are several remedies that may assist in soothing your irritated skin:</p>
<p>The first and foremost thing that one needs to do when suffering from eczema of hands and fingers is to keep them moisturized and avoid over washing. This condition mainly affects people who remain in constant touch with water and chemicals like cleaners, chef, salon, spa and healthcare professionals.

Coconut oil can also be mixed with desi ghee and camphor for external application on the skin.</p>
<p>One of the best-known home remedies for eczema on hands and fingers is using neem for external application as it has antibacterial properties. You may use it to clean the affected area by boiling neem leaves in water. You can also use neem in cooking and consuming as it removes toxins from the blood when consumed regularly. You may also make a paste of neem leaves with fresh butter and apply it to the dry, flaky skin.</p>
<p>Aloe vera gel can also be used to soothe the irritated, flaky eczema skin on hands and fingers. It is rich in antioxidants and has nourishing properties. It can be used in both ways, externally and internally. You may try Jiva Aloe Vera Juice. Drink it with water every morning, preferably on an empty stomach.</p>

<li>Reduce the intake of pitta-aggravating foods like tea, coffee, alcohol, smoking, tobacco, non-veg food, spicy foods like pickles and chutney, fried foods, etc.</li>
<li>Consume amla (Indian gooseberry) as it is cooling in nature. You can also make a powder of neem and amla.

<li>If you experience severe skin itching during this time of the year, apply coconut oil to the affected area. It will soothe your irritated skin and provide some relief.</li>
<li>To balance pitta dosha in the body, consume vegetables that are sweet and bitter in taste like amla and karela. You can also have cabbage, cucumber, radish, potato and carrot. Few fruits are also known to have a balancing effect on the pitta dosha like banana, mango, coconut and melon.</li>
<li>Make sure that your bowel movements are clear. If you are suffering from constipation, consume bowel cleansing foods and herbs. Try to eat green vegetables as much as possible. Drink a glass of milk in the night to have a clear bowel movement or take 1 tsp.<strong><em> triphala churna</em></strong>. You can buy the natural digestive medicine, Jiva <strong><em>Triphala Churna</em></strong>. It will help improve your digestion, relieves constipation, detoxifies the body and also helps in weight management.</li>
<li>For skin-related disorders, mainly<strong> raktashodhan</strong> (blood-purifying) herbs and medicines are suggested. You can also use herbs available near you for this purpose like <strong><em>a</em></strong>loevera<strong>**</strong>. </li>
<li>You can consume fresh aloe vera juice if available or buy aloe vera juice from the online Jiva store. Jiva Neem Syrup is also beneficial for skin-related &amp; pitta dosha disorders.

<li>Therefore, to treat any disorder effectively, it is important to treat it from the root.

<p>Parents have a multitude of worries and questions. What will all of this anxiety, unrest, isolation, and change mean for my kids? How do I help them cope? Will they be okay? The good news is that resilience — the ability to overcome hardship and stress — is something we can learn and strengthen at any age. We can’t prevent our kids from experiencing deep sadness, stress, or setbacks. When possible, though, we can nurture their ability to cope and grow from difficult experiences.</p>
<h2 id=""heading-how-can-families-nurture-resilience"">How can families nurture resilience?</h2>
<p>Resilience starts for each of us in the bond between parent and child, a key contributor to healthy development in children and teens. Research on childhood trauma, such as exposure to violence, divorce, grief, and natural disasters, shows that a safe, stable relationship with at least one caring and responsive adult is a potent buffer against stress. And recent studies suggest that youths who feel connected to a parent or other caregivers and their peers, and follow consistent daily routines, are best equipped to manage COVID-related stress (read more here, here, and here).</p>

## How can families nurture resilience?
Resilience starts for each of us in the bond between parent and child, a key contributor to healthy development in children and teens.

And recent studies suggest that youths who feel connected to a parent or other caregivers and their peers, and follow consistent daily routines, are best equipped to manage COVID-related stress (read more here, here, and here).

## Aim for warm, nonjudgmental connections

- Offer an empathic, nonjudgmental, and open-minded ear. Make space for your kids to candidly share what’s on their minds and how they’re doing.
- Help them identify and name their emotions. Explore what brings those feelings up, then connect those feelings to specific coping skills.
- Acknowledge what we’re all going through right now, and validate that it’s okay to feel the way they do.
- Ask what questions they have, then offer facts in a developmentally appropriate way. If you don’t have the answers, reassure them you will figure it out together.

## Help practice skills for coping and emotional regulation
- Encourage problem-solving for issues big and small. Explain how you tackle problems in your own life and see if they can brainstorm solutions for theirs.
- Nurture calming skills with a self-soothing activity. Take four slow, deep breaths together, snuggle with a pet, list what they’re grateful for, or watch a happy video.
- Shift their attention to the here and now, rather than the past (which can’t be changed) or the future (which has many unknowns). This is the essence of practicing mindfulness, which can reduce the intensity and discomfort of negative thoughts and feelings.

## Try to model healthy coping habits
- In hard times, kids look to their caregivers for cues. When you use coping skills, you not only attend to your own needs, but you encourage them to try these skills out, too.
- Encourage consistent routines, which offer a reassuring sense of structure and normalcy for the whole family during turbulent times.
- Prioritize your physical health: try to get enough sleep, eat a healthy(ish) diet, and find ways to stay active.

## Feeling overwhelmed? Take heart and take care
- Parents, remember you don’t need to do this by yourselves. All of the important people in your child’s life can nurture resilience and teach ways to cope. Leaning on your community of family, friends, neighbors, teachers, coaches, and cultural leaders can increase your own sense of connection and remind you you’re not alone in the struggle.

<h2 id=""heading-what-is-brain-fog"">What is brain fog?</h2>
<p>Brain fog, a term used to describe slow or sluggish thinking, can occur under many different circumstances — for example, when someone is sleep-deprived or feeling unwell, or due to side effects from medicines that cause drowsiness. Brain fog can also occur following chemotherapy or a concussion.
In many cases, brain fog is temporary and gets better on its own. However, we don't really understand why brain fog happens after COVID-19, or how long these symptoms are likely to last. But we do know that this form of brain fog can affect different aspects of cognition.</p>
<h2 id=""heading-what-is-cognition"">What is cognition?</h2>

It becomes even more difficult when an individual starts losing hair in the young, teenage years. Hair loss takes a toll on confidence and self-esteem. Teenagers get snide remarks from their fellow mates and feel uncomfortable in social gatherings. In this image-conscious era of taking selfies and posting Instagram stories, receding hairline makes the person feel more vulnerable and rejected. So, is there anything that can stop hair fall? How to stop hair loss in teenage guys? Yes, there is a solution to this problem. In this blog, we’re going to address common reasons for which teenagers start losing their hair and how they can stop it.</p>

<li><p>The first and foremost thing to remember is that hair loss is a medical condition, not a cosmetic problem. It is important to identify the root cause of your hair fall. Hair fall can be due to various reasons like nutritional deficiency, unhealthy lifestyle, stress, medication, frequent use of chemicals on the scalp &amp; hair, diabetes, etc. Therefore, consulting an Ayurvedic specialist for a personalized and root-cause based natural solution for your hair fall is important.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The second most important thing is to take care of your nutritional intake. A healthy, balanced diet is the key to everything, including healthy hair. A diet that is not high enough in iron &amp; protein can lead to hair loss. Those with eating disorders or are on a diet or gyming excessively without supplementing it with a nutritious diet often experience hair loss. If a poor diet is your issue, you can usually reverse hair loss by balancing your food intake.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use natural hair care products. Chemical-laden shampoos, conditioners, hair gel, different salon products make your hair silky, shiny and smooth but in the long run, they cause more harm than good. Instead, use natural, herbs based hair care products. You can try <strong>Jiva’s</strong> range of Ayurvedic hair care products.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use fenugreek seeds for hair fall control as they contain vitamin C, A and K, potassium, calcium, folic acid and nicotinic acid. They prevent hair fall and support scalp health. You can soak some fenugreek seeds overnight. Make a paste of it and mix it with some curd. Apply this pack at least 30 minutes before you wash your hair.

","Experiencing hair loss, at any age, is an embarrassing condition. It becomes even more difficult when an individual starts losing hair in the young, teenage years. Hair loss takes a toll on confidence and self-esteem. Teenagers get snide remarks from their fellow mates and feel uncomfortable in social gatherings.

How to stop hair loss in teenage guys? Yes, there is a solution to this problem. In this blog, we’re going to address common reasons for which teenagers start losing their hair and how they can stop it.

## How to stop hair loss in teenage guys?

1. The first and foremost thing to remember is that hair loss is a medical condition, not a cosmetic problem. It is important to identify the root cause of your hair fall. Hair fall can be due to various reasons like nutritional deficiency, unhealthy lifestyle, stress, medication, frequent use of chemicals on the scalp & hair, diabetes, etc. Therefore, consulting an Ayurvedic specialist for a personalized and root-cause based natural solution for your hair fall is important.

<p>These statistical averages are relevant and valid in the research of conventional drugs because they ignore the subjectivity in drug research. Similarly the structural framework of double blind and triple blind clinical trials are also leading to statistical averages to come to conclusions. These approaches are efficient only up to the point wherever averages in the measured physiological and biochemical parameters in the human body are relevant. They are defective and insufficient as research tools for homeopathy as homeopathic drug discovery research goes beyond the basics of biomolecular medicine to the level of genetics and immuno-genetic modulations. The physiological processes at the level of genetics and immunogenetics are individualistic, not common for all. Moreover at this level the influence of subjectivity is remarkable. This is the reason for success of homeopathic medication in millions of patients around the world who were declared incurable by conventional medicine.</p>
<p>We have discussed many examples starting from thalidomide induced genetic defects and list of drugs banned year after year to demonstrate the fallacies of the conventional approach of drug discovery. All drugs from thalidomide to the most recently banned drugs have gone through these so called rigorous animal experiments and many levels of clinical trials like double blind and triple blind studies. Then, why do all these drugs produce such disastrous consequences like genetic anomalies and serious other side effects when clinically used in patients? We need only simple common sense to understand that the drug discovery system in conventional modern medicine is unscientific or that the science on which it is based is incomplete and not the final word and thus the product created is defective and harmful to human beings. Fundamental rule in any medication is that the drugs prescribed should not produce more pain and suffering than the original disease. But here it is indeed so.</p>
<p>If we analyse these so-called scientific methodologies with the current level of knowledge in genetics, they are archaic. Yet the pharma industry and their apostles projects them as the most advanced and scientific methodologies out of ignorance or for simple profit motives. How long will they be allowed to continue this fraud on human health? Policy makers around the world should understand this point and there should be a concerted effort to re-write the Flexener’s commandments by a real humanistic scientist. </p>
<p>The first clinical trials in modern times started with the trial of ‘patulin’ for the common cold in 1943 in the UK. It was the first double blind controlled trial. Then came the first randomised controlled trial of streptomycin in pulmonary tuberculosis, again in the UK in 1946. Everyone should note that these ultimate research tools (various stages of clinical trials) as the basis of conventional drug discovery are pre-DNA discovery period protocols. Even today research methodology of drug discovery does not consider the genetic uniqueness of each human being to whom it is prescribed. This is a very serious defect that is not given cognizance in the pharmaceutical industry. Keeping an outdated protocol which does not take into account the basic genetic system of human beings, is the biggest fraud and greatest crime against humanity. The attempt to universally inject COVID -19 vaccines based on mRNA needs to be understood in this context. It is not only an attempt to deny the basic freedom and personal choice of individuals but can damage the genetic code of human beings irreparably. It is high time for the political leaders to use their human instincts as well as intellect and broad knowledge rather than depending on the so called experts who are prejudiced and closely linked to the industry. Political leaders should understand that their decisions are linked to the larger questions of existence.</p>
<p>Homeopathy is a medical system discovering drugs exclusively by studying their effect directly on healthy human subjects (drug proving experiments) by using 30C potency of a given drug or substance. This makes the methodology of homeopathic drug discovery fool proof and pristine. We also note that the drugs discovered by Dr Hahnemann (99 drugs) to the drugs recently included in the homeopathic pharmacopoeia,  are all in daily use in homeopathy. Not even a single drug is banned or withdrawn anywhere due to adverse side effects. Faithful believers of conventional medicine claim that homeopathic drugs do not produce side effects as they are just water or placebo. But as a researcher who did one decade of studies with homeopathic ultra-high dilutions with advanced electron microscopy (HRTEM &amp; EDS, FESEM &amp; EDS) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), I am confident that these high dilution medicines are the rich source of nanoparticles of the original drug substance (See ref. book Nanodynamics and other published research papers in peer reviewed journals). I am also sure that millions of patients cured of their illnesses with this personalised nanomedicine (Homeopathy) are the living examples of a worthy science to heal human diseases.</p>
<p>The proponents of one medical system for the world should realise that the so called modern medicine they are trying to implement in human society is an outdated science utilised to the maximum as a business enterprise, has little or no scope for the future. It is an empire ready to crumble.</p>
<p>Human society needs different thoughts and approaches for any problems which are complex. Keeping every system of medicine active and growing, one can replace or complement another when need arises. If someone has dominance and refutes other thoughts and approaches, they will try to eliminate otherness. At this juncture, it is good to be aware of something that happened in China around 1955. As conventional modern medicine was gaining dominance in China, the leaders of the Chinese Medical Association met the the Chairman Mao and told him that the traditional Chinese healing practices are unscientific and outdated, needs to be abandoned as it takes some resources meant for health care (same argument we have heard recently from UK regarding the NHS budget on homeopathic hospitals, sadly the political leadership caved into this illogical argument, yet the British Royals have have the conviction beyond the ‘experts’ common sense). It seems that Mao listened to them carefully for an hour and replied to them that the people of China had lived well and healed well with traditional medicine for 10,000 years and if you don’t understand the science behind it, you just leave it and practice whatever you have learned. He just decided that conventional modern medicine was not a replacement for Traditional Chinese medicine, but an additional one. With this Mao proved his grit and created a balance, which preserved the traditional Chinese medicine in equal footing with conventional modern medicine. China and the world at large immensely benefited from this one decision of Mao. Every head of state and health ministers around the world need similar conviction and decisiveness to save humanity from the current COVID – 19 pandemic or the more dangerous pandemic which ‘Philanthropist’ Bill Gates recently predicted, hence the world is waiting for.</p>
<p>In the current state of affairs, Germany can lead the world in this positive direction as homeopathy was born and flourished in Germany and still remains strong in the thoughts of people. It is a critical responsibility of the German political leadership to reinstate homeopathy as the primary health care solution for the population. As the questions about the scientific basis of homeopathy is being established in multiple ways, integrating homeopathy into the health care system in Germany, or any other nation is not a difficult task. It seems Germany has good human resources in homeopathy. Such a step can bring universal change in health care in a very short time. If the political leadership decides, it is only a matter of time to solve the complete scientific puzzles remaining with homeopathic drug action.</p>
<p>The political leaderships around the world have a critical responsibility to safeguard the human race rather than facilitate the profit making of the pharma and medical industry. If they fail in doing so, they are failing the human race, which they are committed to protect. In this time of crisis a sane political leadership is more worthy of trust than the agenda based bureaucratic officials and leaders of the health industry. Let us hope for Mao’s wisdom in every leader in the world, as far as medicine is concerned. </p>

<p>First of all we should all know what is energy?
Energy is a quantitative force which makes all things work. It is the basic back bone of any process to take place.
Without energy things or people cannot function. When things are at rest then also they have energy in stored form or energy which is still known as potential energy.
When the energy helps to make things work or when it is in motion it is known as kinetic energy.
So basically energy is present all the times both in living and non living things .It can neither be created or destroyed but converted from one form o]to other and makes things function.
Without energy both the animate and the <strong>inanimate</strong> world cannot function and it is universally present.</p>
<p>In all living things like plants, animals and human beings this basic energy was recognized by Dr Samuel Hahnemann as the vital force.
Vital force helps to maintain a state of health and metabolic equilibrium in human beings.</p>
<p>This vital force when present in an healthy individual helps to carryout all the bodily functions with ease in the individuals .
But when it gets deranges due to morbific influence on it the health and the metabolic equilibrium gets disturbed leading to various diseases.</p>
<p>Now to thing to bring to highlight is that the modern system of medicine i.e vide allopathy system of practice propagates that all disease if of the body i.e begins in the body and ends in the body.
The energy concept is not there.</p>
<p>But homoeopathy advocates that all disease begins with first changes on the basic energy level and then is transferred on the body level.</p>
<p>Another thing to bring to notice to the reader?? is that our mind ,our thoughts and our feelings are also part of our energy make up.
they form a major part of our energy body.
This fact can be recognized as we cannot see our thoughts but we know they can be very powerful.
To establish this fact Quantum science/Quantum Mechanics comes to our rescue.</p>
<p>Quantum physics has clearly established that all atoms have energy pockets ,i.e energy is the form of quarks make up electrons , protons and neutrons which were previously thought to be the smallest particles present.</p>
<p>And quarks cannot be seen by the naked eye. They are micro <strong><em>nano</em></strong> particles.
The smaller the particle ,more powerful it becomes as it carries the most amount of energy.
Example of this is the nuclear atomic bomb???which being created from a <strong>nano</strong> particle can cause destruction on the level of our genetic material
It is a well established fact that .people exposed to radiation of atomic bomb material even years after can suffer major congenital abnormalities and <strong><em>psychological </em></strong>maldevelopment.</p>

<p>So we can say that Homoeopathy is a complete science which establishes the psychosomatic and energy connection of the diseases and can play a major role in eradicating various chronic diseases including mental derangements both on the functional and pathological level(<strong>eg AUTISM,ADHD, etc</strong>.) and also various hard to cure diseases like Cancer, Aids and Congenital abnormalities etc. which plague the humanity.

","## What is energy?

First of all we should all know what is energy?
Energy is a quantitative force which makes all things work. It is the basic back bone of any process to take place.
Without energy things or people cannot function. When things are at rest then also they have energy in stored form or energy which is still known as potential energy.
When the energy helps to make things work or when it is in motion it is known as kinetic energy.
So basically energy is present all the times both in living and non living things .It can neither be created or destroyed but converted from one form o]to other and makes things function.
Without energy both the animate and the **inanimate** world cannot function and it is universally present.

In all living things like plants, animals and human beings this basic energy was recognized by Dr Samuel Hahnemann as the vital force.
Vital force helps to maintain a state of health and metabolic equilibrium in human beings.

This vital force when present in an healthy individual helps to carryout all the bodily functions with ease in the individuals .
But when it gets deranges due to morbific influence on it the health and the metabolic equilibrium gets disturbed leading to various diseases.

Now to thing to bring to highlight is that the modern system of medicine i.e vide allopathy system of practice propagates that all disease if of the body i.e begins in the body and ends in the body.
The energy concept is not there.

But homoeopathy advocates that all disease begins with first changes on the basic energy level and then is transferred on the body level.

Another thing to bring to notice to the reader?? is that our mind ,our thoughts and our feelings are also part of our energy make up.
they form a major part of our energy body.
This fact can be recognized as we cannot see our thoughts but we know they can be very powerful.
To establish this fact Quantum science/Quantum Mechanics comes to our rescue.

Quantum physics has clearly established that all atoms have energy pockets ,i.e energy is the form of quarks make up electrons , protons and neutrons which were previously thought to be the smallest particles present.

And quarks cannot be seen by the naked eye. They are micro ***nano*** particles.
The smaller the particle ,more powerful it becomes as it carries the most amount of energy.
Example of this is the nuclear atomic bomb???which being created from a **nano** particle can cause destruction on the level of our genetic material
It is a well established fact that .people exposed to radiation of atomic bomb material even years after can suffer major congenital abnormalities and ***psychological ***maldevelopment.

Dr Hahnemann put forth a hypothesis , two centuries back that morbific organisms can be the cause of diseases in individuals which has been very well proved by discoveries of various bacteria and viruses present in our environment which can cause various infectious and chronic diseases.
One of them being the latest , THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS.?

Coming back to the the diseased state , the individual gets diseased firstly on the energy level.
for eg if the person is about to gets a normal viral fever, the first symptoms to show would be decreased energy levels with decreased functioning abilities, general weakness of the spirits or the mind, and also of the body, decreased appetite etc.

This changes show that the person has been influenced by some morbific influence which has attacked the vital force and is about to bring forth changes in the body chemistry and finally manifesting as full blown symptoms of fever , cold cough , respiratory problems or digestive problems etc. depending upon the course of the disease.

One of classical examples Dr Hahnemann has given is that a person feels nauseous b being exposed to any prisoned food substance(even sight and smell of that food substance causes nausea) before showing symptoms of food poisoning like diarrhea and vomiting.
Nausea here is the responding of the vital force to prisoned food .

<p>As I have been exploring the relationship between Ayurveda and allopathy, it is amazing to see the amount of opinions that are floating around about the issue.</p>
<p>As one common and practical theme that I see emerging is the usefulness of adding modern understanding of human body and illnesses that allopathy has to Ayurveda to develop it further, I need to make a deeper point that really needs cognition by humanity at large.</p>
<p>To start with, the core difference between most things Indian and western is the antiquity.</p>
<p>Allopathy and Ayurveda are incomparable in terms of the duration for which they have served humanity.</p>
<p>Allopathy as we know it now, is a product of technological advancements in our ability to “see” the inner workings of the body and hence most of its curative practices are barely 200 years old. Ayurveda, on the other hand, has been around for almost 1000/2000 years, if not more.</p>
<p>If we really want to understand what it means, there is one very simple question we have to ask for allopathy.</p>
<h2 id=""heading-will-allopathy-as-we-know-it-works-for-the-next-2000-years"">Will allopathy as we know it works for the next 2000 years?</h2>
<p>An honest doctor who is watching antibiotic resistance rising or lifestyle problems emerging from those who receive quick cures from modern medicines would have to accept that it is extremely unlikely for most current allopathy medicines to work for even next fifty years.</p>
<p>And if we speak to an evolutionary biologist, it gets worse as we get an Armageddon of pathogens becoming immune meeting humanity weakened by escaping natural selection due to allopathy. </p>
<p>So, it is clear that allopathy, at this point is a bit like a quick fix of curing a human body but a scary harbinger of a massive crisis for humanity at large.</p>
<p>If we look at Ayurveda, it may not be able to cure a plague or malaria that allopathy can, but it surely has its own slow way of bringing an imbalanced body back to balance and hence it is not helping pathogens to evolve and mitigating lifestyle diseases by offering a way of life through its slow and holistic cure that has more than just medicine popping as a cure.</p>
<p>If we really start looking at “curing” as a bigger problem in the context of humanity, it is clear that allopathy is great in curing an individual human while it is blind to the cause of the greater collective that we are and hence, while it solves the problem for one and now, it also causes more problems to the whole of humanity that has to exist over a greater length of time.</p>
<p>As we have now started understanding the bigger interconnectedness and continuity to be part of the problem statement in other sectors like climate change, we also need to use the same logic for healthcare as a whole, because curing one person now at the cost of millions later is surely not a wise move forward.</p>
<p>While I am questioning allopathy for its short-sightedness, it doesn’t mean that Ayurveda has it going right for it and must be adopted as-is in replacement of allopathy for the greater good.</p>
<p>It is clear that Ayurveda has also got its problems and shortfalls because of it being developed in the era where our understanding of the human body was extremely limited, making Ayurveda as a bit like finding what is wrong with the car by listening to its engine without opening the hood of the car.</p>
<p>What we need is to develop allopathy using Ayurveda’s understanding of curing a human body using its own immune system by working on the overall metabolism.</p>
<p>Allopathy needs to learn from Ayurveda to slow down and let the body heal. We all should realise that there is no quick cure to any illness and hence our hurry of not missing the next movie or next opportunity to make money resulting in popping a few antibiotics has to be set aside for the sake of entire humanity.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Ayurveda can also continue developing its own way of diagnosis and cure using its own tools and medicines. Let us grasp that unlike allopathy’s clinical trials of a couple of years, Ayurveda can be looked at as clinical trials conducted over thousands of years and hence it can be a treasure trove for pharmacognosy.</p>
<p>We need to help allopathy and Ayurveda develop to reach a point of natural convergence instead of the forced one that AYUSH is attempting.</p>
<p>If Ayurveda will meet allopathy at this point, the humans looking for quick cures will force Ayurveda to become another allopathy and humanity may lose something that it is in dire need today.## </p>

As I have been exploring the relationship between Ayurveda and allopathy, it is amazing to see the amount of opinions that are floating around about the issue.

As one common and practical theme that I see emerging is the usefulness of adding modern understanding of human body and illnesses that allopathy has to Ayurveda to develop it further, I need to make a deeper point that really needs cognition by humanity at large.

To start with, the core difference between most things Indian and western is the antiquity.

Allopathy and Ayurveda are incomparable in terms of the duration for which they have served humanity.

Allopathy as we know it now, is a product of technological advancements in our ability to “see” the inner workings of the body and hence most of its curative practices are barely 200 years old. Ayurveda, on the other hand, has been around for almost 1000/2000 years, if not more.

If we really want to understand what it means, there is one very simple question we have to ask for allopathy.

## Will allopathy as we know it works for the next 2000 years?

An honest doctor who is watching antibiotic resistance rising or lifestyle problems emerging from those who receive quick cures from modern medicines would have to accept that it is extremely unlikely for most current allopathy medicines to work for even next fifty years.

And if we speak to an evolutionary biologist, it gets worse as we get an Armageddon of pathogens becoming immune meeting humanity weakened by escaping natural selection due to allopathy. 

So, it is clear that allopathy, at this point is a bit like a quick fix of curing a human body but a scary harbinger of a massive crisis for humanity at large.

If we look at Ayurveda, it may not be able to cure a plague or malaria that allopathy can, but it surely has its own slow way of bringing an imbalanced body back to balance and hence it is not helping pathogens to evolve and mitigating lifestyle diseases by offering a way of life through its slow and holistic cure that has more than just medicine popping as a cure.

If we really start looking at “curing” as a bigger problem in the context of humanity, it is clear that allopathy is great in curing an individual human while it is blind to the cause of the greater collective that we are and hence, while it solves the problem for one and now, it also causes more problems to the whole of humanity that has to exist over a greater length of time.

As we have now started understanding the bigger interconnectedness and continuity to be part of the problem statement in other sectors like climate change, we also need to use the same logic for healthcare as a whole, because curing one person now at the cost of millions later is surely not a wise move forward.

While I am questioning allopathy for its short-sightedness, it doesn’t mean that Ayurveda has it going right for it and must be adopted as-is in replacement of allopathy for the greater good.

It is clear that Ayurveda has also got its problems and shortfalls because of it being developed in the era where our understanding of the human body was extremely limited, making Ayurveda as a bit like finding what is wrong with the car by listening to its engine without opening the hood of the car.

What we need is to develop allopathy using Ayurveda’s understanding of curing a human body using its own immune system by working on the overall metabolism.

Allopathy needs to learn from Ayurveda to slow down and let the body heal. We all should realise that there is no quick cure to any illness and hence our hurry of not missing the next movie or next opportunity to make money resulting in popping a few antibiotics has to be set aside for the sake of entire humanity.

On the other hand, Ayurveda can also continue developing its own way of diagnosis and cure using its own tools and medicines. Let us grasp that unlike allopathy’s clinical trials of a couple of years, Ayurveda can be looked at as clinical trials conducted over thousands of years and hence it can be a treasure trove for pharmacognosy.

We need to help allopathy and Ayurveda develop to reach a point of natural convergence instead of the forced one that AYUSH is attempting.

If Ayurveda will meet allopathy at this point, the humans looking for quick cures will force Ayurveda to become another allopathy and humanity may lose something that it is in dire need today.## ",false,0,0,0,Allopathy,5305.7225,0,0,true,false,false,false,false,false,0,false,0,false,true,false,false,false,true,20db8cc4-61e4-44f0-8f59-aa10715e5f7c,1,,,allopathy-and-ayurveda,Allopathy and Ayurveda,0,6236f4888e4fae3f767de868,Allopathy and Ayurveda, Curing a human now and curing humanity for ages,story,https://unsplash.com/@raimondklavins,Raimond Klavins,false,Allopathy and Ayurveda,Curing a human now and curing humanity for ages,true,61bf260bc4195d32e16a3653,allopathy-and-ayurveda,"Mar 20, 2022",cl0z2y3xf039ssynv1x48ap8k,61bf25b9c4195d32e16a364f,1,6236f3128e4fae3f767de83c,false,false,4,0,https://prodstage-audioblog-hnaudioblog3e1448cf-shw992q87veq.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cl0z2y3xf039ssynv1x48ap8k,true,1,6236f4888e4fae3f767de868,5e4dfdfa-323c-4ac2-a8a0-143dc670ac48,2,1,20db8cc4-61e4-44f0-8f59-aa10715e5f7c,will-allopathy-as-we-know-it-works-for-the-next-2000-years,Will allopathy as we know it works for the next 2000 years?,,,,,,,,,,,,,1647770409008,,,false,false,true,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

<h2 id=""heading-find-motivation"">Find motivation</h2>
<p>What motivates you? Where will you find good reasons to change? Yes, studies show that being at a healthy weight and shape is associated with a longer life and lower risk of many chronic diseases.

<p>Examples of this include aiming for at least 21 minutes of activity per day and/or five servings of fruits and vegetables per day.

<p>Healthy choices can become more automatic if you remove the ""choice"" part. For example, take the thinking out of every eating or activity decision by planning ahead for the week to come:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Choose a basic menu for meals and build in convenience</strong>
Focus on simple, healthy recipes. Frozen produce is healthful, easy to keep on hand, and sometimes less expensive than fresh. Shopping the salad bar costs more, but could help on busy nights.</li>
<li><strong>Jot down your activity schedule</strong>
Choose some physical activity most days — the more vigorous and the longer the better, but anything counts! Even as little as 10 minutes of light to moderate activity per week has been associated with a longer life span.</li>
<li><strong>Track food and activity choices each day</strong> Using an app or notebook for this can help you become more aware and accountable. Try noting barriers, too, and brainstorm workarounds for overly busy days and other issues that push you off track.</li>

The most recent data in 2018 from the CDC shows that 42.7% of US adults are obese (defined as a body mass index of 30 kg/m2 or greater). Furthermore, childhood obesity is a serious problem in the US, with the prevalence of obesity at 19.3% and affecting about 14.4 million children and adolescents ages 2 to 19. One in two US adults has diabetes or prediabetes, and about 50% of adults have cardiovascular disease.</p>
<h2 id=""heading-what-is-the-potential-benefit-from-a-national-program-to-reduce-sugar"">What is the potential benefit from a national program to reduce sugar?</h2>
<p>A recent study published in the American Heart Association’s journal Circulation examined a model to estimate changes in cardiometabolic disease (specifically type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and obesity) and health care costs if sugar reduction targets were initiated. In 2018, the US National Salt and Sugar Reduction Initiative (NSSRI) proposed voluntary national sugar reduction targets. For each of 15 food categories, the targeted reduction in average sugar content was 20% by the end of 2026, except for sugar-sweetened beverages, which were targeted for reduction by 40%. The model looked at diet data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2011 to 2016, sugar-related diseases from numerous other research studies, and health-related costs.</p>
<p>Results from the study estimated that a government-supported sugar reduction policy could prevent approximately 2.5 million cardiovascular disease events (stroke, heart attacks, and cardiac arrests); 500,000 cardiac deaths; and 750,000 cases of diabetes over the lifetimes of adults in the US ages 35 to 80. The data also showed that this reduction of sugar could save $160.88 billion net costs from a societal perspective over a lifetime.</p>
<h2 id=""heading-natural-sugars-and-added-sugars-whats-the-difference"">Natural sugars and added sugars: What’s the difference?</h2>
<p>Naturally occurring sugars are found naturally in foods such as milk (lactose) and fruit (fructose). Any product that contains milk (yogurt, milk, and cream) or fruit (fresh, dried, and frozen) contains some natural sugar.</p>
<p>Added sugars include any sugars or caloric sweeteners that are added to foods or beverages during production or preparation (such as putting sugar in your coffee or adding sugar to your cereal). The leading sources of added sugars in the US diet are sugar-sweetened beverages, and desserts and sweet snacks. Examples of desserts and sweet snacks are cookies, brownies, cakes, pies, ice cream, frozen dairy desserts, doughnuts, sweet rolls, and pastries. Added sugars includes natural sugars such as white sugar, brown sugar, and honey, as well as other caloric sweeteners that are chemically manufactured (such as high fructose corn syrup).</p>

<p>The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that women limit added sugar to no more than 6 teaspoons a day (24 grams) and men limit added sugar to no more than 9 teaspoons per day (36 grams).</p>

<p>The impact of added sugar on our health and health care costs is staggering. On an individual level, there are a few strategies to begin the journey to reduce added sugar in our own diets. On a societal level, getting behind a government-sponsored reduction of added sugar may help save lives and significantly reduce health care costs.</p>
","Research studies over the past 30 years have shown that high consumption of added sugar, especially from sugar-sweetened beverages, contributes to obesity, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes. The most recent data in 2018 from the CDC shows that 42.7% of US adults are obese (defined as a body mass index of 30 kg/m2 or greater). Furthermore, childhood obesity is a serious problem in the US, with the prevalence of obesity at 19.3% and affecting about 14.4 million children and adolescents ages 2 to 19. One in two US adults has diabetes or prediabetes, and about 50% of adults have cardiovascular disease.

## What is the potential benefit from a national program to reduce sugar?

A recent study published in the American Heart Association’s journal Circulation examined a model to estimate changes in cardiometabolic disease (specifically type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and obesity) and health care costs if sugar reduction targets were initiated. In 2018, the US National Salt and Sugar Reduction Initiative (NSSRI) proposed voluntary national sugar reduction targets. For each of 15 food categories, the targeted reduction in average sugar content was 20% by the end of 2026, except for sugar-sweetened beverages, which were targeted for reduction by 40%. The model looked at diet data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2011 to 2016, sugar-related diseases from numerous other research studies, and health-related costs.

Results from the study estimated that a government-supported sugar reduction policy could prevent approximately 2.5 million cardiovascular disease events (stroke, heart attacks, and cardiac arrests); 500,000 cardiac deaths; and 750,000 cases of diabetes over the lifetimes of adults in the US ages 35 to 80. The data also showed that this reduction of sugar could save $160.88 billion net costs from a societal perspective over a lifetime.

## Natural sugars and added sugars: What’s the difference?

Naturally occurring sugars are found naturally in foods such as milk (lactose) and fruit (fructose). Any product that contains milk (yogurt, milk, and cream) or fruit (fresh, dried, and frozen) contains some natural sugar.

Added sugars include any sugars or caloric sweeteners that are added to foods or beverages during production or preparation (such as putting sugar in your coffee or adding sugar to your cereal). The leading sources of added sugars in the US diet are sugar-sweetened beverages, and desserts and sweet snacks. Examples of desserts and sweet snacks are cookies, brownies, cakes, pies, ice cream, frozen dairy desserts, doughnuts, sweet rolls, and pastries. Added sugars includes natural sugars such as white sugar, brown sugar, and honey, as well as other caloric sweeteners that are chemically manufactured (such as high fructose corn syrup).

The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that women limit added sugar to no more than 6 teaspoons a day (24 grams) and men limit added sugar to no more than 9 teaspoons per day (36 grams).

","## First things first: Vaccinate everyone

In the US, the CDC and FDA have reviewed the necessity, safety, and effectiveness of boosters for the Pfizer/Biotech, Modena, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. I’ll discuss these recommendations in a moment.

But first, it’s important not to overlook this fact: vaccinating the unvaccinated should be a much bigger priority than giving booster shots to those who’ve received vaccines. That goes for people in the US who have been unable or unwilling to get the vaccine, and people in places throughout the world with limited access to vaccines.

## Is there a difference between a booster dose and a third shot?

It’s not trick wording: not all extra vaccine doses are boosters. In August 2021, the FDA approved a third dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for people who are immunocompromised. This includes people who have HIV and those receiving treatment for cancer that suppresses the immune system.

## Getting the timing and dose right on vaccine boosters

Ideally, vaccine boosters are given no sooner than necessary, but well before widespread protective immunity declines. The risks of waiting too long are obvious: as immunity wanes, the rates of infection, serious illness, and death may begin to rise.

But there are downsides to providing boosters too early:


- **Side effects might be more common**

A booster dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine has also been authorized for all adults 18 or older two or more months after the first dose.

## Mixing or matching booster shots
The FDA and the CDC have concluded that mixing or matching vaccines when getting a booster dose is safe and effective. Regardless of the initial vaccine you received, any of the three available vaccines may be given as a booster.

## What is the study?
